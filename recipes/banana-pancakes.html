        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fluffy pancakes are super easy to make, and absolutely delicious! They are also a great base for you to add any topping onto.</p>
        <p>The order of steps when making them is important, as it affects how fluffed up the pancakes will turn out. Be sure to add the baking soda before adding any of the flour! The batter will make a sizzling sound.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 bananas</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>230ml milk</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4g baking powder</li>
            <li>120g flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Topping of your choice, such as bananas, blueberries, chocolate, jam,...</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mash the bananas until the texture is gooey.</li>
            <li>Mix in the egg and milk.</li>
            <li>Add in baking powder and stir. The mixture should begin sizzling.</li>
            <li>Gradually mix in the flour. Be careful not to overmix, as that would reduce the fluffy-ness of the pancakes.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into pre-heated pan at medium heat. Let cook until no more bubbles form and flip over. Pancake should rise once turned over. Remove once golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
